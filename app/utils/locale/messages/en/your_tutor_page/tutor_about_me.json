      "content": "My passion lies in everything patterned, especially Maths, Physics, and Computer Science. I have been sharing this passion through private tutoring for over 10 years, beginning during my first year of university.\n\nBorn in Hong Kong, I have been fascinated by maths and patterns since childhood. My dedication to studying paid off with excellent grades in Hong Kong's public exams. In the HKCEE (grade 11), I achieved A's in Maths, Additional Maths, Chemistry, and Biology, and B's in Physics and Economics. In the HKALE (grade 13), I earned an A in Physics and a B in Pure Maths.\n\nI graduated with a B.Sc. in Mathematics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2015. The Math department there is renowned across Asia for its competitiveness and challenging undergraduate courses. My time there was truly the best of my life.\n\nAfter graduation, I continued tutoring part-time while working as a Software Engineer.\n\nIn 2021, I moved to Vancouver to broaden my horizons and completed a Diploma in Computer Studies at Langara College. I achieved top marks in all my courses, earning the Langara President's Trust Scholarship, awarded to the student with the highest GPA in their program.\n\nI currently work as a tutor at multiple tutoring centers and also offer private lessons in Vancouver."
