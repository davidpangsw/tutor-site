# Overview
The SAT Math section assesses high school-level mathematical skills needed for college success.

The test covers four areas:
- Algebra (13-15 Questions)
- Advanced Math (13-15 Questions)
- Problem Solving and Data Analysis (5-7 Questions)
- Geometry and Trigonometry (5-7 Questions)

Like the Reading and Writing section, the Math section is divided into 2 modules. Over the course of the Math section, you’ll answer multiple-choice and student-produced response questions that measure your fluency with, understanding of, and ability to apply the math concepts, skills, and practices that are most essential.

The math questions are divided into four categories. Questions from all four categories appear in each test module. Across each module, questions are arranged from easiest to hardest, allowing you to have the best opportunity to demonstrate what you know and can do.

# SAT Calculator Policy
Students may use their own acceptable calculator on test day or take advantage of the graphing calculator built directly into the testing application.

If you choose to bring your own calculator to use throughout the Math section, there's more to it than making sure you've got a fresh set of batteries.
- Calculator Rules
    - Bring your own calculator. You can't share with someone else.
    - You may not use a calculator while working on the Reading and Writing section. You must put the calculator under your desk during these modules of the test.
    - Calculator covers must be kept under your desk at all times.
    - You'll be dismissed and your scores canceled if you use your calculator to share information during the test, or to remove test questions or answers from the test room.

Calculator Tips
    - If you're not familiar with the Desmos calculator that's embedded in the digital test, take some time to learn how to use it while taking a practice test on the Bluebook™ app or on desmos.com/calculator.
    - If you prefer to bring your own calculator, don't bring a brand-new calculator. Bring one you know. Practice for the test using the same calculator you'll use on test day.
    - The Math section includes some questions where it's better not to use a calculator, even though you're allowed to.
    - It may help to do scratch work on the scratch paper provided. Get your thoughts down before using your calculator.
    - Make sure your calculator is in good working order and that the batteries are fresh. The test center won't have batteries or extra calculators. If your calculator fails during testing and you have no backup, you can continue testing using the built-in Desmos graphing calculator.

Acceptable Calculators

- If you have a calculator with characters that are one inch or higher, or if your calculator has a raised display that might be visible to other test takers, you will be seated at the discretion of the test coordinator.

- Only battery-operated, handheld equipment can be used for testing. No power cords are allowed for calculators.

- Calculators permitted during testing include:
    - Most graphing calculators (see chart)
    - All scientific calculators
    - All four-function calculators (not recommended)
